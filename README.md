# Project Title: Creating a Shop

## Objective:

- Write a program that welcomes the user as a customer of the shop.
- The program takes the user's name as input.
- Identifies the customer (whether it's their first, second, or third visit).
- Offers the products and services available in the shop.
- The customer places their order.
- Their shopping list is displayed for confirmation.
- Once the shopping list is confirmed, the customer receives an invoice.
- If the customer is on their third visit, they receive a 2% discount.

## How Does It Work?

1. Welcome:
    - Once the program is launched, it asks for and records the user's name.
    - It welcomes the user.
    - The program then offers the products and services of the shop.
    - Note: The price of each product is displayed to the right of it.

2. Product Purchase:
    - A unique identifier is assigned to each product in stock.
    - The customer places their order using these identifiers.
    - Once the products are chosen, the customer must specify the desired quantity of each selected product.
    - A confirmation list is displayed by the program, specifying the different totals for each product.
    - The customer must confirm the shopping list or choose to return to the welcome screen.

3. Invoicing:
    - An invoice is generated for any customer whose purchase has been confirmed.
    - Invoices are stored in the "Clients" folder.
    - If the customer has more than one visit, they can review their previous invoices if needed.
    - Each customer is given a 2% discount starting from the third visit.

## Code

- The code is written in Python and we have used as many functions as possible to facilitate understanding of the code.
- Each function in the code is designed to perform one or two specific tasks.

The source code has been explicitly commented for better understanding. Thank you.
